<h2>Hi there, I'm Shashwat Niranjan 👋</h2>

```javascript
class Developer {
    constructor(name, goal) {
        this.name = name;
        this.role = "Full Stack Developer (MERN) & Python Enthusiast";
        this.focusAreas = ["Node.js", "Express.js", "React", "TypeScript"];
        this.secondaryInterests = ["Python/FastAPI", "Web3"];
        this.currentGoal = goal;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`);
        console.log(`I'm a ${this.role} building for the modern web.`);
        console.log(`My current mission: ${this.currentGoal}.`);
    }
}

const me = new Developer("[Your Name]", "Google Summer of Code 2026");
me.sayHello();
```

🚀 I'm currently on an intensive deep-dive into the MERN stack, building a solid foundation from HTTP servers to full-stack applications.

🎯 My primary goal for early 2026 is to become a high-impact open-source contributor and get selected for GSoC.

🌱 I'm documenting my progress and challenges in my Learning Log repository as I work through my goals.

♟️ P.S. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me planning my next move in a game of chess.
