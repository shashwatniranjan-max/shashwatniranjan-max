üöÄ I'm currently on an intensive deep-dive into the MERN stack, building a solid foundation from HTTP servers to full-stack applications.
üéØ My primary goal for early 2026 is to become a high-impact open-source contributor and get selected for GSoC.
üå± I'm documenting my progress and challenges in my Learning Log repository as I work through my goals.
‚ôüÔ∏è P.S. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me planning my next move in a game of chess.
